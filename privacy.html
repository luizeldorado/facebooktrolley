<h1>Facebook trolley problem generator privacy policy</h1>

<p>I do keep the names of Facebook friends in the server as the image itself. Currently there is no way to delete that, I'm sorry. You can contact me directly if you really want those images to be deleted (eldorado.luiz@gmail.com). Of course, the filename of those images is your Facebook ID, which should be public anyway. Nothing else is kept in the servers.</p>
